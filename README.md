# E Learning Web Pages For Computer Science
# Secure Learn: Cybersecurity Training Web Page


## Project Description

This project aims to develop interactive web pages that inform people about important cybersecurity awareness topics. Modules on subjects including social engineering, password security, and phishing will be available on the platform. Through the use of simulations and real-world examples, each module will actively illustrate cybersecurity principles. Users will be able to assess their learning through interactive challenges, scenario-based exercises, and quizzes. JavaScript will be used in the development of the webpages to allow for interactivity.


## Project Outcomes:
 
- An interactive web platform that functions and illustrates important cybersecurity principles.
- A tool that evaluates users' comprehension of cybersecurity risks and remedies.
- The improvement of programming and web development abilities, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
